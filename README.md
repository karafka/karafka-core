## Karafka-Core

Karafka-Core contains toolset of small support modules used throughout the [Karafka](https://github.com/karafka/karafka/) ecosystem.

It includes:

- `Karafka::Core::Monitoring` - default instrumentation and abstraction that allows to use either itself, `dry-monitor` or `ActiveSupport::Notifications`.
- `Karafka::Core::Configurable` - configuration engine inspired by `dry-config` with similar but simplified API.
- `Karafka::Core::Contractable` - contracts inspired by `dry-validation` but with simplified API.
- `Karafka::Core::Taggable` - adds ability to attach `#tags` to objects for extra labeling.
