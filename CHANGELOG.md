- Move `librdkafka` generic (producer and consumer) patches from WaterDrop here.
- Move dependency on `librdkafka` here from both Karafka and WaterDrop to unify management.

## 2.0.4 (2022-11-20)
- Disallow publishing events that were not registered.
- Fix a potential race condition when adding listeners concurrently from multiple threads.

## 2.0.3 (2022-10-13)

## 2.0.2 (2022-08-01)
- Add extracted statistics decorator (#932)

## 2.0.1 (2022-07-30)
- Fix a case where setting would match a method monkey-patched on an object (#1) causing initializers not to build proper accessors on nodes. This is not the core bug, but still worth handling this case.

- Initial extraction of common components used in the Karafka ecosystem from WaterDrop.
