      # Many of the librdkafka statistics are absolute values instead of a gauge.
      # This means, that for example number of messages sent is an absolute growing value
      # instead of being a value of messages sent from the last statistics report.
      # This decorator calculates the diff against previously emited stats, so we get also
      # the diff together with the original values
      #
      # It adds two extra values to numerics:
      #   - KEY_d - delta of the previous value and current
      #   - KEY_fd - freeze duration - describes how long the delta remains unchanged (zero)
      #              and can be useful for detecting values that "hang" for extended period of time
      #              and do not have any change (delta always zero). This value is in ms for the
      #              consistency with other time operators we use.
